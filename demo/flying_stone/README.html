<h1 id="Flying-Stone"><a href="#Flying-Stone" class="headerlink" title="Flying Stone"></a>Flying Stone</h1><p>This is a birthday gift for my friend. Thanks for her long-term support and encouragement. When I was under heavy depression, it was her beautiful and bright smile that took off the shadow from my life.</p>
<h1 id="A-letter"><a href="#A-letter" class="headerlink" title="A letter"></a>A letter</h1><p>Today, Dec 7th, it’s your birthday. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! I am extremely pleased as little princess is growing up. I’ve prepared a gift, which is a game developed by myself. I hope you will love it.</p>
<p>I think I shall express my gratitude for your long-term encouragement. Every time I was under heavy depression, you always showed up and throwed so much inspiration resisting difficulties to my heart. I remember the address you used to call me, which planted my confidence thoroughly. I never forget that you said I have many things you are jealous of - yes, we should cherish those we have gotten rather than be disappointed in what we have lost. I have carved my heart with your concerns. When I hurt my right eye and was critisized by my parents, it was your warm messages that melt the ice in my heart and took off the shadow from my eyes. My mind is full of many fantastic memories with you…</p>
<p>No sooner do I meet my old friends than I usually would like to give them a broad smile, as I love the time that I spent with them. We respect each other, so we are friends. Class 6 rarely gives me this feeling. My noble princess, you are much more modest and optimistic.</p>
<p>I really have this thought that we will keep friendship forever, no matter how much fortune we earn and what status we attain in the society.</p>
<p>Yours loyalt,<br>Yuehao</p>
